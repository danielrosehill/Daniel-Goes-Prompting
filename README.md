# Daniel Goes Prompting

A place to record my open-ended experiments in prompting GPTs (especially the GPTs but sometimes Claude and other LLMs).

I created this repo with the idea of recording various prompting "voyages" in a semi-organised fashion and ultimately pushing this repo onto a blog. 

While an awful lot of my prompting is mundane (*please convert this CSV to MD and try to preserve the structure*) I sometimes go on more offbeat and adventurous "voyages" attempting to explore the capabilities of GPTs or just discover random knowledge. 

Those are the kind of prompts I wish to publish here.
