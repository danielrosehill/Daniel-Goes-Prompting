# Prompt

In your average desktop computer, which component is most susceptible to hardware failure? Which component might be considered the weakest link? Assume NVME/SSD

# Output

In a desktop computer with NVMe/SSD storage, the most susceptible component to hardware failure is often the **power supply unit (PSU)**. PSUs are critical because they supply power to the entire system, and their failure can lead to shutdowns, crashes, or even damage to other components. Additionally, **motherboards** are also prone to failure due to issues like capacitor wear or electrical surges over time. **Cooling fans** and **GPUs** can also fail due to heat, but the PSU is typically the weakest link overall.
