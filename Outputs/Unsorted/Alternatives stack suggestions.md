# Prompt

Let me provide a quick recap. We've decided that MongoDB is worth a try and we've also decided that Mongoose makes sense as an ODM. I'm going to define the schema in the ODM as a first step. I'm looking for an admin framework to begin developing the frontend for this tool and your top recommendation so far is AdminJS.

Can you recommend some other potential solutions that would work with the stack we've picked so far? Avoid "no code" solutions but try to find frameworks or templates that would make building this as easy as possible.

# Output

Based on your recap and requirements, here are some alternative solutions that would work well with your MongoDB and Mongoose stack, while providing an easier development experience for building the admin frontend:

1. React Admin:
   - A powerful and flexible admin framework for React
   - Works well with MongoDB and can be integrated with custom Mongoose backends
   - Provides a rich set of components for building CRUD interfaces
   - Highly customizable and extensible

2. Retool:
   - Low-code platform (but not no-code) for building internal tools
   - Can connect directly to MongoDB and supports custom JavaScript
   - Allows for rapid development of admin panels and dashboards
   - Offers a balance between ease of use and customization

3. Blitz.js:
   - Full-stack React framework with built-in admin functionality
   - Works well with MongoDB and Mongoose
   - Provides scaffolding for CRUD operations
   - Offers a more opinionated structure, which can speed up development

4. Keystone.js:
   - Headless CMS and application framework built on Node.js
   - Native support for MongoDB and Mongoose
   - Provides an auto-generated Admin UI
   - Offers a good balance between customization and out-of-the-box functionality

5. Strapi:
   - Headless CMS that can be used to quickly build customizable admin panels
   - Supports MongoDB out of the box
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for content management
   - Extensible through plugins and custom code

6. MERN Admin Boilerplate:
   - Not a framework, but a starter template for MERN stack admin panels
   - Includes basic CRUD functionality and authentication
   - Can be a good starting point if you want more control over the codebase

These options provide various levels of abstraction and customization. React Admin and Blitz.js offer more flexibility but require more coding, while Retool and Keystone.js provide more out-of-the-box functionality. The choice depends on how much customization you need and your comfort level with different technologies.
