# Prompt

I often worry about losing my Android phone (Samsung A23 5G). I think mostly because I have no plan for how i would go about getting the apps I use back on the phone. Do you have any recommendations for a really good backup tool I could use? This phone isn't rooted and I don't plan on rooting it.
