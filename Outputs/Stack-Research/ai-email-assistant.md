Great. I've asked you this before I believe, but I'm having a hard time keeping on top of my work inbox which is full of messages. It's Google Workspace. I'm very open to the idea of using an AI tool that would help me manage my inbox more effectively. I'd love to have features like the ability to automatically flag conversations I haven't responded to or to automatically join up related threads. Ie, features that go beyond those built into workspace. Can you think of any good tools for this purpose? I'm far less interested in AI features like writing assistance and automatic composition. Rather, I'm looking for a tool to streamline retrieval of information.

# Output

Based on your specific needs for managing your Google Workspace inbox, I can recommend a few AI-powered email management tools that focus on organization, retrieval, and workflow optimization rather than composition assistance:

1. **Shortwave:** This tool is particularly well-suited for your needs[5]. It offers:
   - AI-powered email search, allowing you to ask questions to surface old conversations without manually searching
   - Data extraction from email threads (e.g., "make a list of all the tasks in the website redesign project")
   - Automatic organization of emails, with the most urgent first
   - Thread consolidation, which helps join up related conversations

2. **SaneBox: T**his tool is excellent for keeping your inbox organized[4][5]. It offers:
   - AI-driven email categorization into different folders
   - Learning from your behavior to improve categorization over time
   - Works natively with your existing email client, including Google Workspace

3. Clean Email: This tool focuses on inbox organization and cleanup[2][4]. It provides:
   - AI-powered bulk actions and automated organization
   - Filtering and collating emails into groups based on various criteria
   - Automated actions for ongoing inbox management

4. EmailAnalytics: While primarily an analytics tool, it can help you understand your email patterns to manage your inbox better[4]. It offers:
   - Data-driven insights into your email habits
   - Identification of important conversations you haven't responded to

5. Hiver: Although it's more team-oriented, it has features that could be useful for individual inbox management[3]. It offers:
   - Email delegation and collaboration features
   - Task tracking related to emails
   - Workflow automation

These tools focus more on organization, retrieval, and workflow optimization rather than AI composition features. They can help you streamline your inbox management, automatically flag conversations needing responses, and in some cases (like Shortwave), even join related threads.

Remember to check the specific privacy and security features of any tool you consider, especially when dealing with work emails. Also, some of these tools may require administrator approval for use with Google Workspace, so you might need to consult with your IT department before implementation.

## Recommendation

Based on your requirements for a powerful tool that focuses on organization and retrieval rather than composition assistance, I recommend trying **SaneBox**. Here's why:

1. **Tiered Pricing**: SaneBox offers flexible pricing options (Snack, Lunch, Dinner) that allow you to choose based on your needs and budget.
2. **Focus on Organization**: It excels in intelligent email sorting and categorization, which aligns with your goal of streamlining information retrieval.
3. **Native Integration**: SaneBox works seamlessly with your existing Google Workspace setup without requiring a separate interface.
4. **Learning Capability**: It improves over time by learning from your email habits, potentially offering long-term benefits in inbox management.
5. **Moderate Pricing**: At $7-$35 per month, it offers a good balance of features and cost, especially compared to more expensive options like Superhuman.

While Shortwave offers powerful AI features, its focus on writing assistance may not align with your primary needs. Boomerang and Spark are cost-effective alternatives, but they may not offer the same level of organizational power as SaneBox.

I suggest starting with SaneBox's "Snack" tier at $7/month to test its capabilities. You can always upgrade to a higher tier if you find you need more features or email accounts.
