# Prompt

Let's roll back a bit. As you know I'm currently using an Obsidian vault to store my LLM chats - or at least some of them. I capture prompts, outputs, agent configs. Recently I added a folder for context in which I'm storing these context documents. My rationale for doing so was to have the folder within easy access. However, I feel like the context repo should ideally be a separate "component" so to speak. What are your thoughts on this. Do you think a Github repo makes sense as an initial system? Or can you suggest some other way for a user to carefully manage and store their personal context inventory?

# Output

Separating your context repository from your main Obsidian vault is a thoughtful approach, especially if you aim to manage it as a distinct component. Here are some considerations and alternative options for storing and managing your personal context inventory:

### 1. **Using a GitHub Repository**
- **Version Control**: A GitHub repository provides version control, allowing you to track changes over time, which is particularly useful for maintaining your context documents.
- **Collaboration**: If you ever choose to collaborate with others or seek feedback, GitHub allows easy sharing and collaboration on documents.
- **Access Control**: You can choose to keep the repository private if you're concerned about the confidentiality of your context data.
- **Markdown Support**: Since GitHub supports markdown files natively, your context documents can be easily rendered and viewed in a structured way.

### 2. **Dedicated Context Management System**
- **Use of Tools**: Consider using dedicated tools for knowledge management that can complement or replace Obsidian for context storage. Examples include:
  - **Notion**: Allows for rich text formatting, databases, and easy linking between pages, making it suitable for context management.
  - **Roam Research**: Focuses on networked thinking and is great for capturing context and connecting ideas dynamically.
  - **TiddlyWiki**: A personal wiki that can be customized for context management.

### 3. **Local Database**
- **SQLite or Similar**: Create a local SQLite database to store your context documents. This allows you to query and manage your data easily without needing a full-fledged database system.
- **Custom Interface**: You could develop a simple interface or use scripts to input and retrieve your context data, making it a tailored solution for your needs.

### 4. **Cloud Storage Solutions**
- **Google Drive or Dropbox**: Use cloud storage solutions to organize your context documents. You can create folders for different categories and easily access them from anywhere.
- **Automation**: Use tools like Zapier to automate organization, such as moving files based on naming conventions or modifying metadata.

### 5. **Personal Documentation Framework**
- **Markdown-Based Documentation**: Continue using markdown files but store them in a dedicated directory outside of Obsidian. You could create a simple file naming and organization convention that categorizes context documents logically.
- **ReadMe Files**: Include a `README.md` file in your context directory to provide an overview of the contents and organization of your context documents.

### 6. **Hybrid Approach**
- **Use Both Obsidian and GitHub**: You can keep your LLM chats and prompts in Obsidian for easy access and manage context documents in a GitHub repo. Sync relevant context documents between both systems using scripts or manual updates.

### Summary
Choosing the right method depends on your specific needs, preferences, and how you envision interacting with your context data. A GitHub repository is a strong choice for version control and collaboration, but other tools and approaches like Notion or SQLite may offer additional functionality that suits your workflow. 

Ultimately, consider what works best for your organization style, access needs, and future scalability. If you'd like more details on implementing any of these solutions, just let me know!
