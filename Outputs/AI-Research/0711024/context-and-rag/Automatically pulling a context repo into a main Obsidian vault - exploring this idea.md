# Prompt

Now here's another idea to explore. In my main Obsidian vault for managing my LLM work, I'd like to attach my context repo as a Github submodule. That way (I think!) I can pull from the context repo into the vault and manage the context repo as a separate data pool. For this to work, I'd really want to pull the context repo whenever I launch the vault. Or at least have it pull on some kind of schedule whenever the vault is open and being accessed. Do you think this could work? Could you suggest an implementation?

# Output

Integrating your context repository as a GitHub submodule within your main Obsidian vault is a clever approach that allows for separate management of context while enabling easy access and updates. Here’s how you can implement this idea effectively:

### Overview

1. **Git Submodules**: By using Git submodules, you can link your context repository to your main vault. This allows you to pull updates from the context repo as needed.
2. **Automated Pulling**: Implementing a script to automatically pull updates from the submodule whenever the vault is opened can streamline the process.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create Your Context Repository

- Ensure that your context repository is already set up on GitHub.

#### Step 2: Add the Context Repo as a Submodule

1. Navigate to your main Obsidian vault directory in the terminal.
2. Use the following command to add your context repository as a submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/your-context-repo.git ContextRepo
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-context-repo.git` with the URL of your context repository.

3. This will create a folder named `ContextRepo` within your main vault containing the context repository.

#### Step 3: Pulling Updates from the Submodule

You have a couple of options to automatically pull updates from the submodule whenever you open your Obsidian vault.

**Option A: Using a Startup Script**

1. **Create a Script**: Write a shell script to navigate to the submodule directory and pull the latest changes.
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/your/ObsidianVault/ContextRepo
   git pull origin main  # or the relevant branch name
   ```
2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

3. **Launch the Script on Startup**: Depending on your OS:
   - **Linux/Mac**: You can add the script to your startup applications or run it whenever you start Obsidian.
   - **Windows**: You can create a batch file or use Task Scheduler to run the script when you open Obsidian.

**Option B: Using a Plugin or Automation Tool**

If you prefer not to use a shell script, you can use tools like:

- **Obsidian Plugins**: If you find or develop a plugin that runs commands on vault open events, you can implement a command to pull the latest from your submodule.
- **Automation Tools**: Tools like AutoHotkey (Windows) or Automator (Mac) can be configured to run the pull command whenever you launch Obsidian.

### Step 4: Managing the Submodule

1. **Updating the Submodule**: Whenever you want to update the context repo:
   - Navigate to the `ContextRepo` folder within your main vault and run:
     ```bash
     git submodule update --remote
     ```
   - This command will pull the latest changes from the context repository’s default branch.

2. **Committing Changes**: If you make changes within the context repo that you want to push back to GitHub:
   - Navigate into the `ContextRepo` folder, commit your changes, and push them to the remote repository.

### Summary

This system allows you to maintain a clear separation between your main Obsidian vault and your context repository while leveraging Git’s powerful version control features. By using submodules, you ensure that updates to the context repo are easily accessible within your LLM work, all while maintaining an organized structure.
