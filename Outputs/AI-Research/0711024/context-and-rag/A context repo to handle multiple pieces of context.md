# Prompt

I have another question that I'd like to explore with the context repo idea. Frequently the type of context that would be helpful consists of a few facts that might be stored in different context notes. You've helped me to understand that this is why RAG is designed this way. Do you think there's any way that we could achieve a similar kind of logic in our more primitive markdown context repo system? Let's say that I want to find a way to combine a few pieces of context into a single output. I don't want to fish through the whole folder. Perhaps we could build out something like a search interface that could return a few results and then aggregate them into a temporary file. Any thoughts?

# Output


Absolutely! You can create a simple search interface to aggregate relevant context pieces from your markdown context repository without needing a full-fledged RAG system. Here’s a structured approach to implement this:

### Overview

1. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search mechanism that scans through your markdown files in the context repository and returns relevant results based on user queries.
2. **Aggregation Logic**: Allow users to select or automatically aggregate pieces of context into a single output file.
3. **Temporary Output File**: Create a temporary markdown file that combines the selected context pieces.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Set Up the Search Functionality

1. **Define the Context Repository Path**:
   - Specify the path to your context repository where markdown files are stored.

2. **Search Script**:
   - Write a Python script that reads through all markdown files in the specified folder, searches for a user-defined query, and returns matching results.

Here’s a simple example of such a script:

```python
import os
import glob

def search_context(query, context_directory):
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through markdown files in the context directory
    for markdown_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(context_directory, "*.md")):
        with open(markdown_file, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            if query.lower() in content.lower():
                results.append(markdown_file)
    
    return results

def display_results(results):
    if results:
        print("Found the following context documents:")
        for idx, result in enumerate(results):
            print(f"{idx + 1}: {result}")
    else:
        print("No matching documents found.")

def main():
    context_directory = "/path/to/your/ContextRepo"  # Update with your path
    query = input("Enter your search query: ")
    results = search_context(query, context_directory)
    display_results(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Step 2: User Selection and Aggregation

1. **User Selection**:
   - After displaying the search results, prompt the user to select specific documents they wish to aggregate. 
   - You could implement a simple numeric input system where the user can enter the numbers corresponding to their desired context documents.

2. **Aggregation Logic**:
   - Write a function to read the selected markdown files and combine their content into a single output markdown file.

```python
def aggregate_context(selected_files, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write("# Aggregated Context\n\n")
        for filename in selected_files:
            with open(filename, 'r') as infile:
                content = infile.read()
                outfile.write(content + "\n\n")

def main():
    # Existing code for search and display results
    ...
    
    if results:
        selected_indices = input("Select the numbers of the documents you want to aggregate (comma-separated): ")
        selected_indices = [int(idx.strip()) - 1 for idx in selected_indices.split(",") if idx.strip().isdigit()]
        selected_files = [results[i] for i in selected_indices if i < len(results)]
        
        output_file = "aggregated_context.md"
        aggregate_context(selected_files, output_file)
        print(f"Aggregated context saved to '{output_file}'.")
```

#### Step 3: Temporary Output Management

1. **Store the Aggregated File**: The script creates a markdown file (e.g., `aggregated_context.md`) containing the combined content of the selected context notes. You can specify a location for this output file, such as the root of your context repo or a designated `/Aggregated` folder.

2. **Review and Edit**: After generating the aggregated file, you can open it in Obsidian or any markdown editor for review and further editing if needed.

### Summary

This approach allows you to simulate some of the functionality of a RAG system within your existing markdown context repository by creating a simple search and aggregation tool. By implementing a Python script, you can search through your context documents, select relevant pieces, and compile them into a cohesive output.

This method maintains the simplicity of markdown files while enhancing your ability to pull together related information without needing to manually sift through multiple documents. If you'd like to explore any specific part of this implementation or need further enhancements, just let me know!
