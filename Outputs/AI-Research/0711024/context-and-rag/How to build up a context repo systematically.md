# Prompt

Let's get back to talk ing about my idea for building up my own context repo. I want to do this for my job. Ie, I want to create a context repo that has my job description. I'd also like to have a few key work projects in there. My question is really how I go about building this out. Do you have any ideas for how I might make the project more systematic? I've thought about creating a custom LLM agent for this purpose - just helping me build up the library. What are your thoughts?

# Output

Creating a context repository for your job is a fantastic idea, and utilizing a custom LLM agent to help build it can streamline the process significantly. Hereâ€™s a systematic approach to building this out:

### 1. **Define the Structure of Your Repository**:
   - **Sections/Topics**: Determine the main categories or sections for your context repo, such as:
     - **Job Description**: Your roles, responsibilities, and key skills.
     - **Key Projects**: Specific projects you're working on, including objectives, outcomes, and your contributions.
     - **Company Information**: Important details about the organization, its culture, and goals.
     - **Industry Insights**: Relevant trends, tools, and methodologies in your field.
   - **File Format**: Decide on a format for storing the information. Markdown is great for readability and structure, while JSON or YAML could be useful for machine readability.

### 2. **Gather Information**:
   - **Content Collection**: Begin collecting and organizing information for each section. You might include:
     - Your job description in your own words.
     - Detailed descriptions of key projects, including goals, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and outcomes.
     - Supporting documents or links that provide further context.
   - **Use Existing Material**: Leverage any existing documents, reports, or notes that can inform your repository.

### 3. **Automate Content Creation with a Custom LLM Agent**:
   - **LLM Agent Development**: Create a custom LLM agent that can help you generate content based on your prompts. For example:
     - Ask the LLM to summarize your job description based on input text.
     - Use it to draft project summaries by providing key details and asking for a concise write-up.
   - **Interactive Learning**: The agent could learn from your feedback. For instance, if it generates a summary, you can provide corrections or enhancements that it can learn from for future prompts.

### 4. **Use Structured Prompts**:
   - Develop a series of structured prompts for the LLM to help guide content generation. For example:
     - "Generate a summary of my job responsibilities based on the following text: [insert text]."
     - "List the key objectives and outcomes of my project on [project name]."
     - "What are some industry trends related to [your field]? Provide concise insights."

### 5. **Organize and Format Content**:
   - As content is generated, format it according to your predefined structure. Make sure to categorize and tag each piece of information for easy retrieval later.
   - Maintain a consistent style or tone across the repository to ensure professionalism.

### 6. **Create a Searchable Database**:
   - Consider implementing a simple database or structured file system where you can store this content and easily search through it.
   - You can use tools like **SQLite** for lightweight local databases or **NocoDB** for a more visual approach to managing structured data.

### 7. **Iterate and Update**:
   - Make this a living document. Regularly update the repository with new projects, changes in your job description, or emerging industry insights.
   - Periodically review the content with your LLM agent to see if it can provide new perspectives or updated information based on recent developments.

### 8. **Utilize Obsidian for Management**:
   - Since you're using Obsidian, you can leverage its features like linking notes, tagging, and backlinks to enhance your context library.
   - Create a dashboard in Obsidian that links to all your sections and highlights important content, making it easy to navigate.

### Summary:
Creating a context repository for your job using a custom LLM agent can significantly enhance how you capture and organize your professional knowledge. By systematically defining structure, gathering information, leveraging automation for content generation, and organizing it all in a way that allows for easy searching and updates, you'll build a valuable resource that can help you in your current role and future endeavors.
