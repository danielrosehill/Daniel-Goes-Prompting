# Prompt

I have another idea. What about setting up a pipeline. The context system is built with simple markdown files but then that is used to automatically build out the proper RAG system. Can you suggest how that implementation might look like and work?

# Output

Setting up a pipeline that takes simple markdown files from your context repository and automatically builds out a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a fantastic way to create an efficient and scalable solution. Below is a suggested implementation of how this pipeline might look and work:

### Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**: Read and process the markdown files to extract relevant context information.
2. **Data Transformation**: Convert the extracted data into a structured format suitable for indexing and storage.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Generate embeddings for the context data using a suitable model.
4. **Indexing**: Store the structured data and embeddings in a database or document store.
5. **RAG System Integration**: Connect the indexed data with an LLM to enable retrieval-augmented generation capabilities.
6. **User Interaction**: Provide an interface for querying the RAG system.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Data Ingestion

- **Script to Read Markdown Files**: Create a script that scans the context repository for markdown files and reads their content.
- **Extract Relevant Information**: Use regex or markdown parsers to extract key sections, such as job descriptions, project details, and insights.

```python
import os
import re

def read_markdown_files(vault_directory):
    context_data = {}
    for markdown_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(vault_directory, "*.md")):
        with open(markdown_file, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            # Extract relevant sections, customize regex patterns as needed
            context_data[os.path.basename(markdown_file)] = content
    return context_data
```

#### 2. Data Transformation

- **Convert to Structured Format**: Transform the raw content into a structured format like JSON or YAML for easier processing and indexing.

```python
def transform_to_json(context_data):
    structured_data = {}
    for filename, content in context_data.items():
        structured_data[filename] = {
            'content': content,
            # Add additional parsing logic here to create structured fields
        }
    return structured_data
```

#### 3. Embedding Generation

- **Generate Embeddings**: Use a pre-trained model (like Sentence Transformers) to create embeddings for the structured context data.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

def generate_embeddings(structured_data):
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Example model
    for filename, data in structured_data.items():
        data['embedding'] = model.encode(data['content']).tolist()  # Convert to list for storage
    return structured_data
```

#### 4. Indexing

- **Store in a Database**: Choose a suitable database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or a document store like Elasticsearch) to store the structured data and embeddings.

```python
import sqlite3

def index_data(structured_data, db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create table if it doesn't exist
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS context (
                        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                        filename TEXT,
                        content TEXT,
                        embedding BLOB)''')
    
    for filename, data in structured_data.items():
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO context (filename, content, embedding) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', 
                       (filename, data['content'], data['embedding']))
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

#### 5. RAG System Integration

- **Connect the Indexed Data with an LLM**: Implement a retrieval mechanism that queries the database to find relevant context based on user input and then uses an LLM to generate augmented responses.

```python
def retrieve_relevant_context(query, db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Implement a search mechanism based on embeddings (for simplicity, this is a placeholder)
    cursor.execute('SELECT content FROM context WHERE filename LIKE ?', ('%' + query + '%',))
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    conn.close()
    return results
```

#### 6. User Interaction

- **Build an Interface**: Create a simple command-line interface or a web interface to interact with the RAG system, allowing users to input queries and receive responses from the LLM.

```python
def main():
    vault_directory = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"
    db_path = "/path/to/your/database.db"
    
    # Pipeline steps
    context_data = read_markdown_files(vault_directory)
    structured_data = transform_to_json(context_data)
    structured_data = generate_embeddings(structured_data)
    index_data(structured_data, db_path)
    
    # Example query handling
    query = input("Enter your query: ")
    relevant_context = retrieve_relevant_context(query, db_path)
    print("Relevant Context:", relevant_context)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary

This pipeline systematically ingests, transforms, embeds, and indexes the context data from your manual repository. By automating these steps, you can efficiently build out a RAG system that leverages your existing markdown files. 

### Future Enhancements

- **Automated Updates**: Implement a way to periodically re-process the markdown files and update the database as the context repository evolves.
- **Advanced Querying**: Enhance the search capabilities by integrating semantic search features based on embeddings.
- **User Feedback**: Introduce a feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the responses generated by the LLM based on user input.
