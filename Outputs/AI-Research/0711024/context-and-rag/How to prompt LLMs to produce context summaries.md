# Prompt

I just prompted you to provide context on the idea as we've explored it today. In effect, I was prompting you to generate a context document. It worked nicely. Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to prompt you for this? Other ways I could have made the request that would have worked - or which could have produced a better output?

# Output

Prompting an AI for context documents or summaries can be refined to enhance clarity and improve the output quality. Here are some suggestions on how to frame your requests effectively:

### Tips for Crafting Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**:
   - Instead of asking for a general summary, specify what aspects you want to be included. For example:
     - "Can you generate a context document summarizing our discussions about the voice-based context gathering system and its implementation steps?"

2. **Use Clear Titles**:
   - Begin with a clear title for the context document you want. This helps set the focus for the output:
     - "Context Document: Overview of Context Module Ideas."

3. **Outline Key Points**:
   - Provide a brief outline of the topics or elements you'd like to see included:
     - "Please summarize the following points in the context document: structure, voice-based gathering, search functionality, and naming conventions."

4. **Request Formatting**:
   - Specify any desired formatting styles (e.g., bullet points, headings) to improve readability:
     - "Generate a context document with sections and bullet points for key features discussed."

5. **Indicate Audience**:
   - Mention the intended audience or purpose to tailor the tone and depth of the content:
     - "Create a context document suitable for someone new to the context module, including definitions and basic explanations."

6. **Ask for Examples**:
   - If relevant, request examples to illustrate certain points:
     - "Include examples of how the context aggregation functionality would work in practice."

### Alternative Ways to Phrase Your Request

1. **Requesting a Summary**:
   - "Can you provide a detailed summary of our discussions on the context module?"
  
2. **Asking for a Comprehensive Overview**:
   - "Please generate an overview document for the context module, including all key features and implementation steps we discussed."

3. **Focusing on Specific Features**:
   - "Create a context document highlighting the voice-based context gathering process and its potential benefits."

4. **Highlighting Use Cases**:
   - "Generate a context document that outlines possible use cases for the context module in personal and work settings."

5. **Seeking Conciseness**:
   - "Summarize the key elements of the context module idea in a concise document format."

### Example Prompt
Hereâ€™s a refined example of a prompt that incorporates some of these elements:
- "Please create a context document titled 'Overview of Context Module Ideas' that summarizes our discussions today. Include sections on the structure, voice-based gathering, search functionality, and possible naming conventions. Use bullet points for clarity and provide examples where applicable."

### Summary
By being specific, structured, and clear in your requests, you can enhance the quality of the output and ensure that the generated context document meets your expectations. If you want to explore more ideas or have specific questions about prompting, feel free to ask!
