# Prompt

One issue I've been thinking about in building up this context vault is the question of how to generate it. There are a few options I'm thinking about. One is that an LLM could parse through an existing output vault. My main Obsidian vault has about 1500 saved outputs. Collectively that creates an awful lot of data that could be used for building up a context repo. Do you have any thoughts on how I could leverage perhaps a local LLM to glob through that and automatically extract the context data?

# Output

To automatically extract context data from your Obsidian vault with 1500 saved outputs, leveraging a local LLM is a great approach. Here’s a potential strategy you could use:

### 1. **Set up a Local LLM**:
   - You can run a local LLM, such as **GPT4All**, **LLaMA**, or **Alpaca**, on your machine. This way, you maintain control over the data, and it’s private.
   - Tools like **LangChain** or **Haystack** could help you integrate LLMs into a local processing pipeline. They offer support for document processing and knowledge retrieval.

### 2. **Glob Through Your Vault**:
   You can use Python to loop through all markdown files in your Obsidian vault. The script would:
   - Read the contents of each file.
   - Send the content to the local LLM for context extraction.
   - Output the parsed context into structured files (YAML or JSON).

### 3. **Use the LLM for Context Extraction**:
   The key step here is to have the LLM recognize useful context information. You can prompt the LLM to:
   - Identify the key subject matter (e.g., "What is the main topic or information in this file?").
   - Extract structured metadata (e.g., people, places, specifications).
   - Summarize the content into a concise "context snippet" for future use.

Here’s how you could build that workflow:

### Step-by-Step Workflow:

#### **Step 1: File Processing** (Python example):
Use Python to read through all files in the Obsidian vault:

```python
import os

# Define the folder path of your vault
vault_path = "/path/to/obsidian/vault"

# Collect all markdown files
markdown_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(vault_path):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(".md"):
            markdown_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
```

#### **Step 2: Extract Content** (Sample LLM prompt):
For each file, send the content to the local LLM. Here’s a sample prompt for context extraction:

```python
# Send file content to the LLM (pseudo-code, depending on your LLM library)
def extract_context_from_llm(content):
    prompt = f"Extract key information and a context summary from the following text:\n\n{content}\n\n"
    # LLM call (depends on your library: GPT4All, LLaMA, etc.)
    response = local_llm.generate(prompt)
    return response
```

You can structure the prompt to focus on:
- Extracting **important details** like technical specs, names, dates.
- Summarizing **the overall context** or purpose of the content.

#### **Step 3: Organize Extracted Context**:
Once you have the extracted context, save it into a YAML or JSON format:

```python
import yaml

def save_context_to_yaml(filename, context):
    yaml_data = {
        "file": filename,
        "context": context
    }
    with open(filename.replace(".md", ".yaml"), 'w') as yaml_file:
        yaml.dump(yaml_data, yaml_file)
```

#### **Step 4: Iterate Over Files**:
Loop through each file in your vault and extract the context:

```python
for file in markdown_files:
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    context = extract_context_from_llm(content)
    save_context_to_yaml(file, context)
```

### 4. **LLM Optimization**:
   - You may need to fine-tune the local LLM to optimize it for summarizing and context extraction based on your specific vault.
   - You can experiment with different prompt templates and instructions to get the most relevant context snippets.

### 5. **Post-Processing**:
After the LLM extracts context data from each file, you can:
   - Review and refine the context snippets for accuracy.
   - Use tagging, categorization, or embedding techniques to make it easy to search and retrieve relevant snippets.

### Tools to Consider:
- **LangChain**: Integrates LLMs into a broader context-aware system. It can help process documents in a meaningful way.
- **Haystack**: Can process, retrieve, and store documents with LLMs and might simplify building your automated system.
- **GPT4All / LLaMA / Alpaca**: For running local LLMs, which allow you to handle your data privately.

This approach could help automate context extraction from your existing vault and make it scalable. Would you like more details on setting up a specific tool like LangChain or GPT4All?
