# Prompt

I'm a bit confused. Explain this whole embeddings idea like I'm a child. I've thought about building my own context library but I was going to just use a regular old Postgres database. Why doe RAG need to store data in embeddings specifically and how do these differ from just storing these snippets of info in regular text?

Alright, imagine you're trying to find a specific book on your shelf, but instead of organizing them by title or author, they're organized by how they "feel" or what they're "about." Weird, right? But that's sort of what *embeddings* do—they take text and turn it into a special set of numbers (kind of like a fingerprint for ideas) that represents the "meaning" of that text. 

These numbers, or "embeddings," make it easier for the computer to understand what a sentence or paragraph is *about*, even if it's worded differently. For example, if I have a sentence like "I like cats" and another one that says "I enjoy felines," a regular text database might treat these two sentences as completely different. But in the world of embeddings, they'd end up with *very similar numbers*, because they *mean* the same thing.

Now, here's where this helps for something like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). When you're building a system where you want to find and use relevant information, like your context library idea, just storing the text isn't enough. You'd want to find text that’s relevant to a new question, even if that new question doesn’t use the exact same words. With embeddings, the computer can "search" the numbers and find things that have a similar *meaning* to the new question.

If you just used regular text in something like Postgres, you'd have to rely on keyword matching or searching for exact phrases, which might miss a lot of important connections between similar ideas. With embeddings, it’s like you have a super smart system that can "feel" what you're asking for and find related info, even if it's worded a bit differently.

Does that make sense? It’s like having a library that understands the meaning of the books, instead of just matching the words on the cover!
