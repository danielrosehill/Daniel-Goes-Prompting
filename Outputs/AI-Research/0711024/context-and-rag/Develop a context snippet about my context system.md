# Prompt

Let's have a go at creating a context snippet. I've just given you some context: about the system I'm using to build a context repository. Can you convert that into a very simple summary that would be easy for an LLM to parse?

# Output

Sure! Hereâ€™s a simplified context snippet based on what you've shared:

**Context:**  
Daniel is building a manual context management system using markdown files to store and organize information. These files, called "context documents," contain specific data or details (e.g., computer specs) that can be referenced in conversations with a large language model (LLM) to provide context without repeating information. The goal is to streamline interactions by manually injecting relevant snippets of information as needed, rather than using an automated system like RAG.

This format keeps things simple and clear for an LLM to understand the key points. Does that work for you?
