# Prompt

Great. So now that you have this context, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts about what format makes the most sense for storing it. Markdown is human readable but JSON is better for machines. What do you think makes the most sense? Perhaps I could create the context library by hand as markdown files and then have a script that would automatically convert those to JSON or update existing JSON files?

# Output

Both markdown and JSON have their strengths, and your idea of starting with markdown and then converting to JSON via a script could give you the best of both worlds. Here’s why:

### Why Markdown for Initial Creation:
1. **Human-readable**: Markdown is easy to read and write, which makes it a great format for when you're manually curating the context snippets.
2. **Widely Supported**: Markdown is supported across various tools and editors, so it's convenient if you're writing or managing the snippets manually.
3. **Flexible Structure**: Since it’s text-based, you can create any structure or layout you prefer without being constrained by strict rules.

### Why JSON for Processing and Retrieval:
1. **Machine-readable**: JSON is perfect for machines to read and process. If you want to automate context injection into LLMs or other systems, JSON makes this straightforward.
2. **Structured Data**: JSON enforces a structured format, which can prevent human error (like missing a key or value) when you move to automation or programmatic retrieval of the context.
3. **Compatibility**: JSON works well with APIs and databases, making it easy to build more advanced systems that interact with your context library.

### A Hybrid Workflow:
Your idea of using markdown for human-friendly editing and then converting to JSON via a script is great. Here’s how it could work:

1. **Create Context in Markdown**: You create and maintain context snippets in markdown files.
   
2. **Script for Conversion**:
   - You can write a simple script (in Python, for example) that reads these markdown files and converts them into structured JSON format.
   - The script could look for specific sections, like headings or key-value pairs, and automatically generate the JSON.

3. **Automate Updates**: When a markdown file is updated, the script could automatically detect changes and update the corresponding JSON file.

### Tools You Could Use:
- **Python markdown parsers**: Libraries like `mistune` or `markdown2` can help you parse markdown into structured text, and then you can use `json` module to export it as JSON.
- **YAML as an Alternative**: Another approach is using YAML, which is also human-readable but more structured than markdown. You could use YAML for editing and convert to JSON automatically since YAML is easily convertible to JSON.

This workflow allows you to keep the simplicity and ease of markdown while ensuring your context library is machine-friendly when needed. Does this approach fit with what you had in mind?


# Input

I'm using Obsidian to manage my "LLM vault" currently which is why markdown is easy for me to work with. I guess I could programatically convert to YAML too

# Output

Using Obsidian for your "LLM vault" makes a lot of sense since it's a great tool for managing markdown content. Converting markdown to YAML is a great next step because YAML provides a structured format similar to JSON but is more human-readable. Plus, YAML is easily convertible to JSON when needed.

Here’s how you could approach it:

### Why YAML Could Work Well:
1. **Human-readable**: Like markdown, YAML is easy to read and write, which keeps your workflow simple.
2. **Structured**: YAML allows for more structure than markdown, which is useful when you want to organize complex data (like lists or nested objects).
3. **Easily Convertible to JSON**: If you decide to use YAML as an intermediary step, you can easily convert it into JSON using most programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).

### Conversion Flow:
1. **Step 1: Markdown → YAML**:
   - Write a script to parse key sections of your markdown files (like titles, metadata, and content blocks) and convert them to YAML.
   - Tools like `PyYAML` (in Python) make it easy to handle YAML.

2. **Step 2: YAML → JSON** (Optional):
   - Once you have the YAML structured properly, you can use a simple script to convert the YAML into JSON whenever needed.

3. **Step 3: Updating YAML/JSON Automatically**:
   - You could set up a system where, when a markdown file is updated in Obsidian, the corresponding YAML and JSON files are automatically generated or updated.

### Example YAML Conversion:
If your markdown file looks like this:

```markdown
# Computer Specs
- Model: ThinkPad E15
- CPU: Intel i7
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 512GB SSD
```

You can convert it to YAML like this:

```yaml
computer_specs:
  model: "ThinkPad E15"
  cpu: "Intel i7"
  ram: "16GB"
  storage: "512GB SSD"
```

### Example Python Script:
You could create a Python script that reads your markdown file, parses it, and converts it into YAML:

```python
import yaml

markdown_content = """
Computer Specs
- Model: ThinkPad E15
- CPU: Intel i7
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 512GB SSD
"""

# Simple parser for markdown to YAML (customize as needed)
lines = markdown_content.strip().split('\n')
yaml_dict = {
    "computer_specs": {
        "model": lines[1].split(": ")[1],
        "cpu": lines[2].split(": ")[1],
        "ram": lines[3].split(": ")[1],
        "storage": lines[4].split(": ")[1]
    }
}

# Save YAML
with open('computer_specs.yaml', 'w') as yaml_file:
    yaml.dump(yaml_dict, yaml_file)

print("YAML file created!")
```

This would give you a YAML file from the markdown, and you can easily extend this to handle more complex structures.

Does this workflow fit your needs? You could easily programmatically manage both YAML and JSON from your markdown base!
