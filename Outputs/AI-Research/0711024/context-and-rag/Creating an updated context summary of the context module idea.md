# Context Module Summary Document

## Overview
The context module is designed to create and manage personal and work-related context repositories effectively. By leveraging simple markdown files, version control, and a structured approach, users can gather, organize, and retrieve context information without the complexities of advanced systems like RAG.

## Structure
The context module will consist of two primary repositories within an Obsidian vault:

### 1. **Personal Context Repository**
- **Folder**: `/Personal`
- **Purpose**: To store personal reflections, experiences, goals, and interests.

### 2. **Work Context Repository**
- **Folder**: `/Work`
- **Purpose**: To capture work-related documents, projects, skills, and job-related information.

### Version Control
Each folder will be managed as a separate Git repository, allowing for:
- Version tracking of changes over time.
- Easy collaboration and sharing if desired.
- Clear documentation of context evolution.

## Implementation Ideas

### A. GitHub Submodule Integration
- Integrate the context repositories as Git submodules within the main Obsidian vault.
- This allows easy access to context documents while maintaining separate management for personal and work contexts.

### B. Voice-Based Context Gathering
- Implement a system using an Android smartphone to gather context through voice notes.
- **Process**:
  1. **Voice Recording**: Users can record voice notes.
  2. **Automatic Transcription**: Use a speech-to-text service to transcribe recordings.
  3. **Parsing**: Extract key insights and format them into structured markdown documents.
  4. **Storage**: Save the parsed documents in the appropriate context repository.

### C. Search and Aggregation Functionality
- Create a search interface to find relevant context pieces across markdown files.
- **Functionality**:
  1. **Search**: Users can enter a query to find matching context documents.
  2. **Selection**: Users select documents to aggregate based on search results.
  3. **Aggregation**: Compile selected documents into a single markdown output file for easy reference.

## Potential Tools and Technologies
- **Obsidian**: For organizing context documents in markdown.
- **Git**: For version control of context repositories.
- **Speech-to-Text Services**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Service for transcription.
- **Python**: For scripting search, aggregation, and context document generation functionalities.

## Benefits
- **Clear Organization**: Personal and work contexts are organized separately for easy navigation.
- **Version Control**: Changes and updates can be tracked over time.
- **Ease of Use**: The combination of voice gathering and automated processes reduces manual effort.
- **Accessibility**: Context information can be retrieved and aggregated quickly, enhancing productivity.

## Summary
This context module aims to streamline the way personal and work-related context is captured and organized. By implementing voice gathering, search and aggregation functionality, and maintaining version control, users can effectively manage their context repositories and improve their ability to retrieve relevant information.
